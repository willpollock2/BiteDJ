Bite Django App

Hello! This is BITE. BITE is an app that displays all of the menu prices of resturants in your area as well as a social feed to help you find food when youre feeling indecisive. It has several features and I will explain them breifely one by one:

Dashboard: The dashboard is the users landing page. It displays quick links to any of the users potential desired locations like recommended resturants, current deals and promotions, and top trending resturants and articles. 

Index: The index allows for instant acces to live menu prices within a 20 mile radius of the user. It will display menu prices of every item in the area including tip and tax to give the user a better estimate of what they would actually spend on the food item (fitlering is at the users discretion). It is followed by a bar chart to visualize the price differences. That is followed by a map of the area to visualize the distance to the resturants.

Survey: The survey pops up after the user selects the BITE logo in the middle of the lower nav. This bring up a quick survery that allows the user to quickly filter food in their area. The user can update a distance slider, price slider, Dine in vs Dine out selector. This will bring you to the index page where the filters will be applied. 

Social: The social feed is where users will come to socialize over the food they love. This feature brings the community together to discuss local food. Whether they had a wonderful or an awful expereince at a resturant, they can discuss it with everyone in their area.

Promotions: This feature displays all of the local discount in a users area. Pretty straight forward!

I hope you enjoy BITE, the application was programmed by me, Will Pollock, and the concept for this was created by Jack Leach, Caitlin Nguyen and myself Will Pollock. 

Thank you!
